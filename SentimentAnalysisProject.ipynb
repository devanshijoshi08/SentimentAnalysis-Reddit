    "### Evaluating which Feature Extraction performs better among the three \n",
    "1. **TF-IDF Performance:**\n",
    "    - Accuracy: 67% \n",
    "    - Precision, Recall, F1-Score: The three sentiment classifications are very equally distributed.\n",
    "    - Observation: TF-IDF appears to function fairly well, indicating that the frequency and distinctiveness of the context in the headlines serve as reliable markers of mood. Recall and precision seem to be fairly balanced with this strategy.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word2Vec Performance:**\n",
    "    - Accuracy: 43%\n",
    "    - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Much worse results, particularly with the positive class that has essentially no recall.\n",
    "    - Observation: The low performance could be attributed to the Word2Vec model's inability to adequately capture semantic relationships in the data, or to the peculiar vocabulary prevalent in Reddit headlines that isn't adequately represented in the Word2Vec model's training corpus.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "3. **GloVe Performance:**\n",
    "    - Accuracy: 55%\n",
    "    - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Not as good as TF-IDF, but still superior to Word2Vec. In contrast, GloVe has a poorer recall but a comparatively higher precision.\n",
    "    - Observation: GloVe's performance indicates that although it is superior to Word2Vec in capturing semantic associations, it is not as good as TF-IDF in providing context-specific understanding for this specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights about the dataset based on the feature extraction techniques:\n",
    "- **Best Overall Method:** In terms of overall accuracy and balance between precision, recall, and F1-score, TF-IDF performs better than GloVe and Word2Vec. This suggests that, for the data collected, Word2Vec or GloVe's semantic word associations are not as predictive of sentiment as TF-IDF's capture of the value of individual terms.\n",
    "- **Dataset Specificity:** Word2Vec and GloVe's performance indicates that the collected data may contain unique terminology or certain contextual nuances that these algorithms are not completely capturing. This may occur in datasets that contain slang, specialised terminology, or inventive language use."
